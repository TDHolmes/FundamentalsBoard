# Fundamentals Board

The Fundamentals Board is an exploration into basic building block circuits.

## Building Blocks

1. Basic BJT circuits
  - Common Collector
  - Common Emitter
  - Current Mirror

2. Basic MOSTFET circuits
  - Common Source
  - Common Drain

3. Operational Amplifier Circuits
  - Schmitt Trigger
  - Integrator
  - Differentiator
  - Square Wave Generator (Also for the rest of the board)
  - Summer

4. Other
  - Source of noise to add to other signals
